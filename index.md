<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to tvk.lol!</h1>

I'm Vince, and this is my personal little web project.

If you're interested in how this site is built, check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/nemvince/tvk-blogs).

## What do I do?

I go to school, code stuff, break my homelab, and occasionally write blog posts about my experiences. Feel free to explore my [blog](/blog) for more insights!
